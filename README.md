### Built with

- CSS Box Model


### What I learned

In this project, I was able to refine and test out my ability to format and style with HTML/CSS to recreate a simple QR code web app. This didn't require a lot of markup, most of the work was in the CSS. 

I'd like to highlight the CSS I used (maybe not the most typical approach) for creating the main div that stored the image and subtext:

```css
#main{
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  position: relative;
  top: 275px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  height: 280px;
  width: 175px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 10px hsl(212, 45%, 80%);
}
```


### Continued development

This project is desktop/laptop only, for now. As my knowledge grows, the app will be more responsive, including a mobile friendly version.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs is a great resource for HTML/CSS documentation, this helped me a lot during this proceess.
